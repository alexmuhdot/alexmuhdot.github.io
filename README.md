Although (probably) rare... Every now and then, I may upload something that I, and hopefully you, will find useful for something or another!

Needful things:

1) Termux setup script. (Command is: "source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexmuhdot/alexmuhdot.github.io/main/termuxsetup.sh)" // WITHOUT SPEECH MARKS
